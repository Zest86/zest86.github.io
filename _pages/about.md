Hi there! I am currently a PhD candidate at [Department of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China, where I am advised by [Prof. Mengshi Qi](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/qimengshi/zh_CN/index.htm). Before that, I received my M.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2023.

My research interests are centered around the intersection of computer vision and physics. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that enable agents to perceive and understand the physical world around them. I am also interested in the application of these algorithms to real-world problems, such as health-related areas and robotic manipulation.
